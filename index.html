            <p>The blues is often thought of as being a simple kind of music, and in some ways it is. Of course, anyone who has ever been moved by a blues performance knows that there must be more to it than the simple chords. Though the chords may by simple when compared to jazz or classical music, blues has great range and complexity in the variety of the tone, touch, groove, and mood. The greatest of the blues players were great because of these subtle and complex instincts, which touch the listener directly.
